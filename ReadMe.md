# Max Stats Add-on

This repository contains a small Minecraft Bedrock add-on that grants all players maximum attack and defense. The behavior pack applies Strength and Resistance effects with high duration and amplifier each tick.

## Installation
1. Copy the `max_stats_bp` folder into your world's `behavior_packs` directory.
2. Enable the pack from the world settings and start the game.

All players will automatically receive the effects when they join.
